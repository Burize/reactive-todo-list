## REACTIVE TODO LIST

Common todo list with create/delete operations. Also, you can receive some push-message.


### Used features

- [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) as stream manager;
- Typescript fro type checking;
- [Axios-observable](https://github.com/zhaosiyang/axios-observable) for handle http actions;
- [Antd](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/) as components kits.
- ServiceWorker for handle push notifications.

There is Service worker with push event handler. At that moment, on server side is not realize push notification. However you can send push directly from chrome devtools (Application tab).

Acceptable format is JSON, like:

```json
{"title": "title from push", "body": "body from push"}
```
